Line  9: Input File. Location of gridinfo file that assigns PFT and area to
         each grid cell. Includes annual N fixation. N deposition amount in this file is ignored 
         (N deposition is read from met.nc files now).
         Internally named filename_cnppoint.
Line 10: Input File. Contains CASACNP parameters for each PFT.
         Internally named filename_cnpbiome.
Line 11: Input File. Describes phenological stages for each grid cell.    
         Internally named filename_phen. 
Line 12: Input File. Contains soil properties for each grid cell.
         Internally named filename_soilprop.
Line 13: Input File. The name of the met file that drives CASACNP.
         For transient runs (initcasa=2 or 3), the year in the filename is  
         replaced by the transient year so N deposition can change over time.
         Internally named filename_cnpmet.
Line 14: Input (startup) file.  Contains initial values for the CASACNP pools 
         when initcasa > 0.  
         Internally named filename_cnpipool.
Line 15: Output file.  End-of-simulation pool values for CASACNP.
         Can be used to initialize subsequent runs.
         Internally named filename_cnpepool.
Line 16: Output file. Average annual CASACNP fluxes during the last "myear" 
         years of the simulation, where myear is the number of years in the 
         met.nc file. Can be used to initialize subsequent runs.
         Internally named filename_cnpflux.
Line 17: Output file. NetCDF file that contains the average daily CASACNP pools
         during the last "myear" years plus average annual CASACNP fluxes during
         the last "myear" years of the simulation, where myear is the number of
         years in the met.nc file. Each year of the transient run will have an 
         output file with 1901 replaced by the transient year, 1901 ... 2100 in  
         this case. Note: for transient simulations, myear = 1. 
         Internally named filename_ncOut.
Line 18: Input File. Contains MIMICS parameters, some are PFT-specific.
         Internally named filename_mimicsbiome.

         Can be used to initialize subsequent runs.
         Internally named filename_mimicsepool.
Line 21: Output file. NetCDF file that contains the average daily MIMICS pools
         during the last "myear" years plus average annual MIMICS fluxes during
         the last "myear" years of the simulation, where myear is the number of
         years in the met.nc file. Each year of the transient run will have an 
         output file with 1901 replaced by the transient year, 1901 ... 2100 in

Line 22: Input File. Initial CORPSE pool values. Contains initial values for the CORPSE pools 
         when initcasa > 0. When initcasa=0 use initial_C values (LABILE,RECALCITRANT,PROTECTED) 
         in corpse_param.nml (filename_corpsenamelist) file.
